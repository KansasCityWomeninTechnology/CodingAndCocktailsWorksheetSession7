### Overview {#overview}
JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is the basis of everything we see on the internet. 

In this session, we will build upon the basics of JavaScript and dive deeper into DOM manipulation, handling events, explore objects and scoping, make API calls, and work with templating.

While we focus on JavaScript, other programming languages share these concepts but the syntax (the format for how you write a specific code statement) may differ slightly from language to language. You will use these concepts often as you write code so practicing what you learn will help a lot!
