# A Deeper Dive into JavaScript {#top}
We will start by practicing JavaScript fundamentals and diving deeper into DOM manipulation before we explore new concepts such as events, objects, and APIs. JavaScript is one of many programming languages used for application development.

Tonight we will create an web application with interactive elements and dynamic content that looks like this:

Before starting the worksheet, please take a moment to review [Setup instructions](/setup) to ensure you have all the tools and workspace setup you need for tonight's work.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}


## Prepare your workspace and serve your web page {#prepare} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
{% include "./1prepare.md" %}

## Create a function and update the text of an element {#text} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We'll write a function that updates the DOM dynamically with text.
{% include "./2elementvalue.md" %}

## Add a counter and update the DOM element text {#counter} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We'll practice using variables and arithmetic operators to add a counter and update the DOM. 
{% include "./3counter.md" %}

## Add conditional logic to display an alert {#conditional} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We want to conditionally display an alert by using `if` and `else` to control code flow.
{% include "./4conditional.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _my-script.js_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on spacing.  
{% include "./checkpoint.html" %}
