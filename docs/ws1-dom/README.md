# A Deeper Dive into JavaScript {#top}
We will start by practicing JavaScript fundamentals and diving deeper into DOM manipulation before we explore new concepts such as events, objects, and APIs. JavaScript is one of many programming languages used for application development.

Tonight we will create an web application with interactive elements and dynamic content that looks like this: JAD TODO: ADD PICTURE

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}


## Prepare your workspace and serve your web page {#prepare} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
{% include "./1prepare.md" %}

## Create a function and update the text of an element {#text} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We'll write a function that updates the DOM dynamically with text
{% include "./2elementvalue.md" %}

## Add a counter and update the DOM element text {#counter} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
{% include "./3counter.md" %}

## Add conditional logic to display an alert {#conditional} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
{% include "./4conditional.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _scripts.js_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on spacing.
