# Objects, Scopes, and this {#top}
Grouping like properties and functionality together can make applications easier to write and maintain. Keeping scope small and targeted is part of that process. These are abstract concepts and will require hands-on practice to connect the dots.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}


## Create an array of objects {#object} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We will create an array of objects and access object properties. 
{% include "./1object.md" %}

## Explore scope of variables {#scope} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Scope affects visibility and access. Let's explore how scope changes the way we interact with objects, properties, and variables.
{% include "./2scope.md" %}

## Use <pre>this</pre> keyword and build a DOM {#this} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
The `this` keyword specifies the scope that we're in. We'll explore `this`, see how it affects access, and build a separate DOM to append to our application's DOM tree.
{% include "./3this.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _scripts.js_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on spacing.
