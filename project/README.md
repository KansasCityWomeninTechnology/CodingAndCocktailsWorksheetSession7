We are going to utilize the drink order app that some of you may have seen during our March version control session or our June jQuery session.  Weâ€™re going to make it interactive and utilize the concepts we discussed tonight.

Note: If you need a refresher on Git version control refer to the March worksheet here: [bit.ly/CnCGit](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCGit&sa=D&ust=1478494043492000&usg=AFQjCNGZlQN2fDsmO63Q_xVBZoyu3-X6tA).
